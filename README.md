# Ruby Event Manager Project

## Project Overview
This is the "Ruby Event Manager" project, a key component of the Ruby programming curriculum offered by The Odin Project. This project is an opportunity for me to apply and demonstrate the Ruby programming skills I have acquired. In this project, I am tasked with creating a program that manages event attendees and utilizes external APIs, specifically Google’s Civic Information API, to enhance its functionality.

This project is not just about building a functional Ruby application; it's also about writing clean, maintainable code and understanding the importance of file manipulation and external API interaction in software development.

## Key Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, I aim to have strengthened my abilities in several key areas:

- **Ruby Fundamentals**: Deepening my understanding of Ruby, including its syntax, data structures, and object-oriented principles.
- **File Manipulation**: Learning to handle file input and output operations, particularly with CSV files.
- **API Interaction**: Gaining practical experience in using external APIs, in this case, Google’s Civic Information API.
- **ERB Templating**: Utilizing Embedded Ruby (ERB) for dynamic content generation.
- **Git & GitHub Proficiency**: Enhancing my version control skills using Git and GitHub, ensuring regular commits and thorough documentation of the development process.
- **Problem-Solving Skills**: Sharpening my problem-solving abilities by implementing complex logic for data parsing and manipulation.

## Getting Started
To approach this project methodically, I plan to:

1. **Repository Setup**: Initialize a GitHub repository to manage and document the project's progress.
2. **Environment Configuration**: Set up the Ruby development environment and ensure all necessary dependencies, such as the Google API Client Gem, are installed.
3. **Incremental Development**: Tackle the project in iterations, starting with basic file reading, then parsing CSV data, followed by implementing API interactions, and finally, integrating ERB templating.
4. **Testing & Debugging**: Regularly test each component of the application, using both automated and manual testing methods to ensure functionality and reliability.
5. **Code Refinement**: Continuously refactor and optimize the codebase, focusing on readability, maintainability, and performance.

## Conclusion
The "Ruby Event Manager" project is an exciting step into the world of Ruby programming and software development. It presents an opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge in a practical setting, creating a foundation for more advanced programming concepts and techniques.

I am enthusiastic about embarking on this journey, embracing the challenges and learning opportunities it presents. This project is not just a task to be completed but a significant milestone in my journey as a budding software developer.
